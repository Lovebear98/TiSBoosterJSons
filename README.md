# TiSBoosterJSons
Consolidated JSons for the Booster Pack in one place, since otherwise it'd require access to up to three locked githubs repos.
Since I'm not certain which specific thing you'd like to translate among the booster, I'm just pooling them all here so you can grab what you'd like!

Base-TiS-Booster is the base booster pack, with the Ironclad/Silent/Defect/Watcher content.

SkulBooster is multiplayer content related to Skul added by the Booster Pack.

UnchainedBooster will be multiplayer content related to The Unchained added by the Booster Pack, after I get permission from that mod dev.
